- Challenges with Element Identification:

    The web store's structural problems make it difficult to define reliable targets for element
    identification using common locators like IDs, XPaths, or CSS selectors. This can result in
    test flakiness and maintenance issues since tests may fail intermittently due to changes in
    the element locators.

- Unpredictable Changes:

    The tight coupling of the test automation framework with the volatile web store structure
    leads to frequent and unpredictable changes in the automation code. With every change in
    the application's UI, test scripts may require updates, resulting in higher maintenance
    efforts and a potential decrease in testing efficiency.

- Brittle Test Automation:

    Due to the difficulty in identifying elements and the web store's frequent changes, the
    test automation suite becomes brittle and unreliable. Test cases may break frequently,
    leading to false negatives, reducing the confidence in the automated tests' accuracy.

- Limited Test Coverage:

    The challenges in maintaining the existing test automation suite might limit the scope
    and coverage of tests for the web store. As a result, important test scenarios and edge
    cases may be overlooked, leading to potential issues in production.

- Collaboration Difficulties:

    The lack of well-defined targets for element identification and the constant changes in
    the structure could lead to misunderstandings and communication gaps between testers,
    developers, and other stakeholders. This might hinder collaboration and lead to a slower
    feedback loop for addressing issues.

Recommendations:

- Adopt a Robust Element Identification Strategy:

    Invest time and effort into implementing a robust element identification strategy using more
    stable locators like unique IDs, accessible labels, or logical class names. Utilize tools like
    data-testid attributes to make element identification more reliable.

- Continuous Monitoring of Test Failures:

    Continuously monitor and analyze test failures to identify patterns and root causes. This proactive
    approach helps in understanding the impact of UI changes and helps in prioritizing the most critical
    fixes.

- Collaborate with Developers and QA:

    Foster regular communication and collaboration between developers and QA to stay informed about
    upcoming changes and ensure early alignment on automation needs.

By addressing these issues and implementing the recommended strategies, the web store's test automation
process can become more stable, maintainable, and capable of providing valuable feedback on the application's
quality. It will help the development team to detect issues early in the development lifecycle and deliver
a more robust and reliable web store to end-users.
